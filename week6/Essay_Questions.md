# Week 6 Essay Questions

## Q1: Edge AI vs. Cloud AI

**Explanation:**
Edge AI involves processing data locally on a hardware device (the "edge") rather than sending it to a centralized cloud server. This approach significantly reduces **latency** because the data doesn't need to travel over a network to be processed and for a response to be returned; decisions are made instantly on-device.

It enhances **privacy** because sensitive raw data (like video feeds or personal audio) remains on the device. Only the inference results or anonymized metadata might be sent to the cloud, reducing the risk of data breaches during transmission or storage.

**Real-World Example:**
**Autonomous Drones:** A drone navigating through a forest needs to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time. If it relied on the cloud, network latency or connection loss could cause a crash. With Edge AI, the drone processes video feeds onboard to identify trees or birds instantly, ensuring safe navigation even without internet connectivity.

## Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI

**Comparison:**
Classical AI relies on binary bits (0s and 1s) and processes information sequentially or with limited parallelism. It struggles with combinatorial optimization problems as the number of variables grows exponentially.

**Quantum AI** leverages quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition). This allows Quantum AI to explore a vast solution space for optimization problems much faster than classical computers. It can handle complex correlations and large-scale optimization tasks that are computationally intractable for classical systems.

**Industries Benefiting from Quantum AI:**
1.  **Pharmaceuticals:** For drug discovery and protein folding simulations, optimizing molecular structures.
2.  **Logistics & Supply Chain:** For optimizing complex routing schedules (Traveling Salesman Problem) and inventory management.
3.  **Finance:** For portfolio optimization and risk analysis, modeling complex market behaviors.
4.  **Energy:** For optimizing power grid distribution and battery material design.
